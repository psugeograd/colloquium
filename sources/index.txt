Graduate students will have the opportunity to submit their most beautiful figure that they have made as part of their research. The submissions will be printed, displayed, and voted on by other students/faculty/staff. We encourage voting criteria to be based on graphical design and aesthetic, as this exhibit is designed to encourage students to step back and consider how to represent their data in the best possible way. The students with the most amount of votes will win a small prize. Dates/times of the exhibit and voting are yet to be determined.

""""""""""""
Overview
""""""""""""

The 2019 Graduate Student Colloquium will be held the 28th and 29th of March in the Pulse of the Earth (240 Deike Building).

The Graduate Student Colloquium is a student-organized annual event that celebrates the research accomplishments of our graduate student community. This event is hosted by the Department of Geosciences and is open to all graduate students involved in geosciences related research.
The Graduate Student Colloquium provides all of us with an opportunity to present our research to the department, receive feedback from faculty judges and peers, and compete for monetary prizes. The colloquium format also stimulates research discussion, and helps students improve their communication skills and think about the broader implications of their work.
The `abstract submission <./02SignUp/index.html>`__ deadline for this year's colloquium will be February 22nd at 5pm. All are encouraged to participate; presentations on research in progress are welcome. If you would like to submit entries to the `photo contest <./02SignUp/index.html>`__, they will also be due on February 22nd at 5pm.

A series of events will take place prior to the Graduate Student Colloquium including a presentation on “how to give a good talk and poster”. For more information on those events, see our online schedule. The Graduate Colloquium Committee wishes to thank in advance the students and faculty for their participation. The Committee also wishes to thank the Shell People Services Division of Shell Oil Company; the Department of Geosciences for their donations of prize money and their generous financial support; and Dave Cannon and his family for their generous donation towards the graduate colloquium awards.
